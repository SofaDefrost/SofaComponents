# STLIB
Sofa Component Library

This library should contains only auto-generated wrapper around Sofa component so they can be used 
in an easy way in our pluins. 


```python
from sofacomponents.ForceField import TetrahedronFEMForceFIeld

def createScene(rootNode):
    TetrahedronFEMForceField()
```

Actually the most usefull aspect of this library is that there is an only documentation on [readthedocs](http://sofacomponents.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
